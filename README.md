<h1><b>Instalation</b><h1>

<h3>Wordpress keywords for autocomplete are merged with the default php keywords stored in php.xml. There are two XML files here, one with descriptions of functions, and the other without them. Rename the file that you want to php.xml and replace the /plugins/APIs/php.xml file ( create a backup of the original file in case you change your mind ).</h3>
